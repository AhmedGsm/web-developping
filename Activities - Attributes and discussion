Activities - Semantic meaning
Please find below suggested activities to help you practice:

   1- How are <header> and <h1> related? What is the difference between them?
   2- Create a well structured HTML page using as many semantic elements as you can.
   3- Write a short HTML page that uses the <div> and <span> tags. You need not style them.
	
1-
<header> and <h1> both represent heading of web page, 
Difference between them:
<h1> used for main titles
<header> used to represent main heading of them page, it might contains logo images, main titles, main navigation,
 main web site introductory,.. 
and it could be used such as a heading of semantic elements such as article, section

		  <h3>Section One</h3>
		  <p>
		  In early operating systems, such as MS-DOS, which employed 
		  command-line interfaces (CLIs), the <mark> screen display consisted</mark> of 
		  characters mapping <strong>directly to a screen</strong> buffer in memory and a cursor position.
		  Input was by keyboard. All this information could therefore be obtained from the
		  system either by hooking the flow of <em>information around </em>the system and reading the screen buffer
		  or by using a standard hardware output socket[10] and communicating the results to the user.

		    For example, the operating system might send messages to draw a command button and its caption. 
		    These messages are intercepted and used to construct the off-screen model. The user can switch between
		    controls (such as buttons) available on the screen and the captions and control contents will be read 
		    aloud and/or shown on refreshable Braille display.
		    Screen readers can also communicate information on menus, controls, and other visual constructs to 
		    permit blind users to interact with these constructs. However, maintaining an off-screen model is a 
		    significant technical challenge; hooking the low-level messages and maintaining an accurate model are both 
		    difficult tasks  <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>

			JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
		    for - loops through a block of code a number of times
		    for/in - loops through the <span id="mytest"> properties of </span>an object
		    while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
		    do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

	    Some telephone services allow users to interact with the internet remotely. For example, TeleTender can read 
		web pages over the phone and does not require special programs or devices on the user side.[citation needed]

	    Screen readers can be assumed to be able to access all display content that is not intrinsically inaccessible. 
		Web browsers, word processors, icons and windows and email programs are just some of the applications used 
		successfully by screen reader users. However, according to some users,[who?] using a screen reader is 
		considerably more difficult than using a GUI, and many applications have specific problems resulting from the 
		nature of the application (e.g. animations in Macromedia Flash) or failure to comply with accessibility standards 
		for the platform (e.g. Microsoft Word and Active Accessibility).
